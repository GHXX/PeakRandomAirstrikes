# PEAK Random Airstrikes

Adds periodic airstrikes to the game that target a random player each time! 
Because *uuuuuuhhhh* Bing Bong Airways does not want to get sued for the plane crash.

For the ultimate mesa experience during the whole run. PvPeak anyone?

Still quite an early version, but fun nonetheless.

## HAS SIDE EFFECTS FOR PERFORMANCE REASONS (OPT-OUT)
The vanilla dynamite explosion seems to be quite expensive in terms of rendering as the explosion cloud consists of 13 individual objects. 
Therefore, the setting **Performance > ReduceExplosionCloudDensity** changes this to just 1 which massively improves performance but looks slightly worse. Simply set it to `false` if you prefer the vanilla behaviour.
